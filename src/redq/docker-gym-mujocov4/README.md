This dockerfile contains commands to setup a new version of mujoco and gym (gym mujoco v4 environments). However, many things in gym have changed from v2 to v4 (e.g. there are now more output from the environment, and seeding has been significantly modified). The v4 version environments are easier to setup and work with, but if you are using a codebase designed for v2 environments, you will need to modify the code to work with the new v4 environments.
